Just a crappy collection of scripts and macros I've made for my roll20 pathfinder games.

pf-1e-conditions-macro is a macro you can paste into your game, but it might take some customization. I was using the tokenmod API script and the 'RPG Token Markers' Token Marker set. Those should be the only requirements for this

The Poison crafting script I just made to make the game go a bit smoother. I think it's some correct rules and some homebrew but I can't really remember. I hate poisons.
